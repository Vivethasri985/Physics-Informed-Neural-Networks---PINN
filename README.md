# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This repository demonstrates a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for solving 2D heat transfer equations using two different datasets (Void and Square). It leverages TensorFlow to model and solve the heat transfer problem efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Heat Transfer
- **Technology Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Problem Solved:** Solves heat transfer equations using a neural network model constrained by physics laws.
- **Datasets:**
  - **Void Dataset (void.xlsx):** Represents heat transfer data for a region with a void.
  - **Square Dataset (square.xlsx):** Represents heat transfer data for a square-shaped region.
